This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r comment=""  }
bike_train <- read.csv("data\\train.csv", header = T)

head(bike_train)
# Using chron functions to dissect the date-time varibale

require(chron)

bike_train$datetime <- as.character(bike_train$datetime)

dates <- t(as.data.frame(strsplit(bike_train$datetime, " ")))
times <- dates[,2]
dates <- dates[,1]

chron_date <- chron(dates = dates,times = times, format = c(dates = "y-m-D" ,  "H:M:S"))

# Creating Months name variable in the dataset
bike_train$month <- months(dates(chron_date) , abbreviate = T)

bike_train$year <- years(dates(chron_date))

bike_train$hour <- hours(chron_date)

bike_train$weekdays <- weekdays(chron_date)

head(bike_train)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

<<<<<<< HEAD
```{r,}
month <- levels(bike_train$month)

year = levels(bike_train$year)

total_rent <- data.frame(y_11 = c() , y_12 = c())

for ( i in month){
   for(j in year){
    month_wise <- subset(bike_train , month == i & year == j)
    total_rent[i,j] = sum(month_wise$count)
   }
}
total_rent$month <- month


barplot(total_rent[,1], ylim = c(0,120000), main = "2011", xlab = "months")

barplot(total_rent[,2], ylim = c(0,120000), main = "2012", xlab = "months")

# As we can see a marked rise in the number of bike rented in year 2012
=======
```{r, echo=FALSE}

>>>>>>> 217acc11731782d3187101743ccf20377de26e2c
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r }

<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
>>>>>>> 217acc11731782d3187101743ccf20377de26e2c

```

```{r}

```
