This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r comment=""  }
bike_train <- read.csv("data\\train.csv", header = T)

head(bike_train)
# Using chron functions to dissect the date-time varibale

require(chron)

bike_train$datetime <- as.character(bike_train$datetime)

dates <- t(as.data.frame(strsplit(bike_train$datetime, " ")))
times <- dates[,2]
dates <- dates[,1]

chron_date <- chron(dates = dates,times = times, format = c(dates = "y-m-D" ,  "H:M:S"))

# Creating Months name variable in the dataset
bike_train$month <- months(dates(chron_date) , abbreviate = T)

bike_train$year <- years(dates(chron_date))

bike_train$hour <- hours(chron_date)

head(bike_train)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r }
a = 3

```

```{r}

```
